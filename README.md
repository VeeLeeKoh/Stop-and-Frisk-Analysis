### Classification of an individual being frisked using stop and frisk data from NYPD
This stop, question and frisk dataset used for this analysis is provided by the New York Police Department (NYPD) and contains information about the "stop, question, and frisk" program implemented by the NYPD (Dataset source included below). It is a controversial and highly criticized policy in which a police officer suspecting someone of wrongdoing is able to stop them, question them, and search them for a weapon. The policy has been highly criticized for being a form of racial profiling.

The full dataset contains records of this policy dating from 2003 to 2019. It includes a record for each stop made, with information about the time of the stop, the location of the stop, information about the officer, the suspect, and other various features.

The data that will be used in this analysis is from the year 2011, which saw the highest number of stops of any year. This data will be used to attempt to **predict whether someone will get frisked** based on the circumstances of the stop and the features of the individual suspect.

We would like to determine what features are most signifcant in determining whether a suspect gets frisked by an officer. Our results could be used to ensure fair and unbiased policing are practiced by the NYPD. This issue is especially vital to reduce police brutality and racial profiling.
